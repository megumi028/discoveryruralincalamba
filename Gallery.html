            <h1>MALAKOKO NG SUCOL
                Natural Hotsprings since kopong-kopong</h1>
        <p>Malakoko is a natural hot spring located on the shores of Laguna Lake in Barangay Sucol. To reach it, 
            one can pass through Malakoko corner, as referred to by the locals of Barangay Sucol and neighboring barangays. 
            There are three small springs in Malakoko: two square-shaped and one circular. 
            The water temperature in each spring ranges from 35 to 40 degrees Celsius, with depths reaching only up to the knees or waist of an adult. 
            The first spring is closest to the lake and has the highest temperature, while the second spring reaches up to half the knee's depth, and the third spring is the largest, with depths reaching up to below the knee. 
            The walls of each spring are made of living rock with a slippery texture due to the algae surrounding them. Around Malakoko,
             there are living rock seats used by people soaking their feet in the hot water.
